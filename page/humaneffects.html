        <p class="articletitle"> Human actions and how they have effected the Earth's environment</p>
        <p class="articletext"> 
           <p class="articletext">Many of humanity's actions have had a negative effect on their home. There are dozens of processes and actions, most of which still going on today, which humans do which harm their environment.
               Instead of describing one of the dozens of humanity's failures, this chapter will recount two times humanity made the right call and stopped one particular process from destroying an integral part of their atmosphere. 
               Our first story begins with a human named Clair Patterson. and an element with 82 protons. Lead, Elenent 82, is extremely dangerous to the human physiology and is harmful to almost all of the life on Earth. Humans had been using lead in
               fuel for vehicles and, unsurprisingly, this lead ended up in the air, soil, water, and just about everything else humans relied upon. Indeed, a few humans had been poisoning the very land they walked upon, themselves, and everybody around them in pursuit
               of green pieces of paper. Thanks to a clever human named Clair Patterson this poisoning was made less severe because he campaigned to remove lead from the fuel. Still, the vehicles were emitting carbon dioxide - a gas which is excellent at trapping heat. 
               The humans seemed not to be content with poisoning themselves with lead but just apathetic enough to be ok with cooking their planet with carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

               Another, slightly more optimistic example of humanity halting an ecological disaster is the story of chlorofluorocarbons. The Earth's atmosphere has an area inhabited by O3 molecules, or ozone. This ozone
               serves the life on Earth by absorbing some of the more detrimental wavelengths of light that the sun emits. Without these O3 molecules, the Earth would be a much less hospitable place. Thus, it was definitely a bad thing when 
               chemicals were being released into the atmosphere that ate away at these ozone molecules. These chemicals, called chlorofluorocarbons, were being used by Humans to refrigerate food more safely. Humanity figured out how bad this was
               and cleaned up their act before they rendered their planet uninhabitable.
