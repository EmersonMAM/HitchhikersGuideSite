        <p class="articletitle"> Notable objects in space near the Earth</p>
        <p class="articletext">The Earth orbits a hospitable G-type main sequence star. It is part of a solar system with thousdands of celestial bodies - 8 of which are  planets. 
            These 8 planets are, listed here in ascending order of their average distance from the solar system's sun, are called Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. <br>

            <br>
            <img src="../res/mercury.jpg"  class="planetimage"> <p class="articletext"  class="planetimage"> Mercury is a rock with diameter 3,032 miles. It has no magnetic field or atmosphere. The humans can see it from Earth and, at some point, named it "Mercury", a god of commerce and merchants.

            <br>
            <img src="../res/venus.jpg"  class="planetimage">
            <p class="articletext"> Venus is a planet with a diameter similar to Earth's and an atmosphere 80 times as dense made of carbon dioxide. This planet also periodically appears in the skys of the Earth and the Humans dubbed it "Venus" after a god of love. At least it's more interesting than shopkeepers.
            <br>
            <img src="../res/mars.jpg" class="planetimage">
            <p class="articletext">We're skipping over the Earth here because this entire section of the Hitchhiker's guide is devoted to it. The next planet on our list is Mars, a planet much smaller than earth with a weak atmosphere and no magnetic field. 
                    Mars is a giant, rust flavored desert inhabited by nothing more than human-made robots  and dust storms.

                    <img src="../res/jupiter.png" class="planetimage">
            <p class="articletext"> Jupiter is the first gas giant we will be talking about. It's the most massive planet orbiting the Earth's sun, about 318 times as massive as the Earth. The planet has a cloudy surface, is made mostly of hydrogen, has many moons (some of which are big and interesting enough to be considered planets in their own right), and was named after a human god of thunder.

                    <img src="../res/saturn.jpg" class="planetimage">

                    <p class="articletext">Saturn is a favorite among the editors here at the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy publishing headquarters. Both its rings and moons are quite beautiful places. It's a gas giant, less massive than jupiter, whose defining feature is its large rings. 
                        The rings are not solid objects - they are areas of orbiting debris formed from the remnants of a moon which was ripped apart by saturn's gravity because the side of the moon closer to Saturn
                        was being pulled more strongly towards saturn than the side of the moon facing away from Saturn. This force disparity tore the icy body apart long ago and now all that remains are the icy particles of the rings.

                    Beyond saturn things get dark and less explored. There are at least two more planets: neptune and uranus, both much smaller than jupiter but bigger and more gaseous than Earth. There's also the kuiper belt objects,
                    small bodies much smaller than even Earth's moons. One of these objects, Pluto, was even believed to be a planet at one point. There are also other objects - rocky bodies kilometers across which orbit the sun called asteroids and 
                    iceballs with long orbits which take them very close to the sun called comets. There are dozens more interesting moons and other interesting structures but for now our tour of Earth's solar system comes to a close.
