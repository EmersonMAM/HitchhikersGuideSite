        <p class="articletitle"> The Human Dilemma</p>
        <p class="articletext"> 
            Humanity hasn’t yet developed the technology to detect alien races, sentient or otherwise. 
            Their space travel is extremely primitive - relying on basic chemistry to propel metal tubes through the air and, assuming these metal tubes don’t explode due to the cocktail of highly explosive chemicals just floating around in their fuel tanks, the metal tube may reach outer space. 
            The humans are currently in that tender phase where they have figured out how to shape molten sand in exactly the correct shape to capture light from billions of distant galaxies, yet even the nearest stars are so incomprehensibly distant that none of their scientists can even imagine how to reach them or how alien species would reach humanity. 
            Indeed, you almost start to feel bad for the little guys - all alone and scared in the universe. 
            Most species deal with this lonely phase intermittent between the invention of the telescope and faster than light travel by creating good art or using it as further motivation for their scientific studies.
            The human psychology prefers to just ignore the problem or, even better, to resist learning enough to understand the vast loneliness which plagues them - both of which are fairly solid strategies.</p>
