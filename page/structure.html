        <p class="articletext"> 
            The Earth's atmosphere is an extremely important feature and sets it apart from other planets. It is divided into 4 major layers.
            <br><br><br>

            The Thermosphere
            <br>
            <img src="../res/thermosphere.jpg"> <br>
            The thermosphere is the uppermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere. This is the Earth's atmosphere's highest up and least dense layer. Air molecules at this layer of the atmosphere can be miles apart. The thermosphere's temperature vary
            wildly from day to night, and at its hottest the Thermosphere can be over 1400 degrees celcius.

            <br><br><br>
            The Mesosphere <br>
            <img src="../res/mesosphere.jpg">
            <br><br>
            The Mesosphere is just below the Thermosphere. It is actually the coldest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, reaching temperatures around -90 degrees celcius. This layer is closer to the ground
            and thicker than the Thermosphere.

            <br><br><br>
            The Statosphere <br>
            <img src="../res/stratosphere.jpg">
            <br>
            The Stratosphere begins about 10km above the Earth's surface, just after the Troposphere ends. The stratosphere contains the ozone layer and is thicker than the mesosphere. 

            <br><br><br>
            The Troposphere
            <br>
            <img src="../res/troposphere.jpg">
            <br>
            The troposphere is the only truly habitable layer of the atmosphere. It is by far the thickest and contains about 80% of the total mass of the Earth's atmosphere. Clouds form here, wind blows,
            animals breathe, etc. It ranges from the Earth's surface to about 10km up.
